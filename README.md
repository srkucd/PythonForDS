# PythonForDS
Full mark coursework of Python for Data Science.

After I graduate, I am adding my own data visualisation and machine learning report weekly.

If you cannot open it via github itself(""Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" ), please try the method below:

1: Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"


2: Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/srkucd/PythonForDS/blob/master/Full%20mark%20report_What%20Globalisation%20Brings%20to%20a%20Country.ipynb") there 

3: Then you get "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/srkucd/PythonForDS/blob/master/Full%20mark%20report_What%20Globalisation%20Brings%20to%20a%20Country.ipynb"

You do not need to install anything.
